== Board Game Score Privacy Policy

Welcome to Board Game Score, your board game companion!

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy is designed to inform you about the types of data we collect, how we use and share it, and what your rights are.

By using the Board Game Score app, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy.

=== Data We Collect

We do not collect any personal data, and all data remains on your device.

The only data we might collect is for debugging (error reports) and performance, which is used to improve the app and is managed directly by the Google and Apple stores.

=== How We Use Your Data

We use your data to improve the app by analyzing usage data to identify popular features, fix errors, and optimize performance.

=== Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties.

=== Data Security

We implement security measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no data transmission over the internet is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

=== Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy on this page and, if possible, through a notification within the app.
